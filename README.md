A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that brings the power of AI to your Xcode projects. This server acts as a bridge between Claude and your local Xcode development environment, enabling intelligent code assistance, project management, and automated development tasks.

## What is Xcode MCP Server?

At its core, this server follows a client-server architecture where Claude can securely interact with your local Xcode projects:

    subgraph "Your Computer"
        Claude["Claude Desktop"]
        MCP["Xcode MCP Server"]
        XP[("Xcode Projects")]

        Claude <-->|"MCP Protocol\n(Commands & Results)"| MCP
        MCP <-->|"Local Access\n(File & Build Operations)"| XP
    end
```

The communication between the Xcode MCP server and your local projects happens entirely on your machine‚Äîyour code is not exposed to the internet. The Model Context Protocol ensures that Claude can only perform approved operations through well-defined interfaces, giving you a secure way to let AI assist with your development while maintaining complete control.

## Key Features

### üîç Intelligent Project Detection
- Automatically finds and connects to your active Xcode project
- Supports manual project selection for precise control
- Maintains workspace context across interactions

### üìÅ Smart File Operations
- Read and analyze Swift, Objective-C, and project configuration files
- Create and modify source files with proper syntax and imports
- Intelligent file listing with type filtering and search

### üõ† Project Management
- Access project targets, configurations, and schemes
- Analyze source files for potential issues
- Execute builds with specific configurations
- Run and manage test suites

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- TypeScript
- Claude Desktop with MCP support

### Quick Setup

1. **Install the Server**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd xcode-server

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Build the project
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   Add this to your Claude Desktop config file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "xcode-server": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/xcode-server/build/index.js"
         ],
         "env": {
           "PROJECTS_BASE_DIR": "/path/to/your/xcode/projects"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace the paths with your actual installation and projects directory.

## Working with the Server

The server provides a natural interface for Claude to assist with your Xcode development. Here are some ways you can interact:

### Project Navigation
Ask Claude to:
- "Set my Xcode projects directory to `/Users/username/Documents/XcodeProjects`"
- "What's my current active project?"
- "Switch to the MyApp.xcodeproj project"
- "Show me all Swift files in the project"

### Code Creation & Modification
Get help with:
- "Create a new view called ProfileView with a preview provider"
- "Add a @Published email property to UserModel.swift"
- "Set up a modern async/await networking layer"
- "Implement Core Data models with SwiftUI bindings"

### Project Analysis & Building
Let Claude assist with:
- "Analyze NetworkManager.swift for potential issues"
- "Build the project in Debug configuration"
- "Run the unit tests for the UserModel module"
- "What build schemes are available?"

## Development and Debugging

### Building the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Troubleshooting
The server provides detailed logging through stderr. Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Project Detection Issues**
   - Verify your projects directory path
   - Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed
   - Check file permissions

2. **Build Problems**
   - Validate Xcode installation
   - Check project configurations
   - Review build settings
